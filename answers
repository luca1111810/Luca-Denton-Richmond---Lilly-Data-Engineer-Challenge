Question 1:

SELECT avg(home_score + away_score) AS "Average number of goals scored" FROM results
WHERE date >= "1900-01-01" AND date < "2000-01-01"


Question 2:

SELECT winner AS "Country", count(*) AS "Number of shootout wins" FROM shootouts
GROUP BY winner
ORDER BY winner ASC


Question 3:

I identified that there are a few instances of the same team playing more than once on the same day.
As a result, the tables must be grouped by date, home_team and away_team.

WITH joined_table AS(
	SELECT results.date, results.home_team, results.away_team, results.home_score,
	results.away_score, results.tournament, results.city, results.country, results.neutral,
	goalscorers.team, goalscorers.scorer, goalscorers.minute, goalscorers.own_goal,
	shootouts.winner, shootouts.first_shooter FROM results

	JOIN goalscorers ON results.date = goalscorers.date
	AND results.home_team = goalscorers.home_team
	AND results.away_team = goalscorers.away_team

	LEFT JOIN shootouts ON results.date = shootouts.date
	AND results.home_team = shootouts.home_team
	AND results.away_team = shootouts.away_team
)

SELECT * FROM joined_table


Question 4:

SELECT shootouts.winner AS "Shootout winners after 1-1 draw" FROM results
JOIN shootouts ON results.date = shootouts.date
AND results.home_team = shootouts.home_team
AND results.away_team = shootouts.away_team
WHERE results.home_score = 1 AND results.away_score = 1


Question 5:

WITH player_goals AS(
	SELECT results.tournament, goalscorers.scorer, count(*) AS goals_per_player FROM goalscorers
	JOIN results ON goalscorers.date = results.date
	AND goalscorers.home_team = results.home_team
	AND goalscorers.away_team = results.away_team
	WHERE goalscorers.own_goal = "FALSE"
	GROUP BY results.tournament, goalscorers.scorer
	ORDER BY results.tournament ASC
),

top_scorers AS(
	SELECT player_goals.scorer AS top_scorer,  player_goals.tournament, MAX(player_goals.goals_per_player) AS goals_scored FROM player_goals
	GROUP BY player_goals.tournament
),

total_goals_per_tournament AS(
	SELECT results.tournament, count(goalscorers.scorer) AS total_goals FROM goalscorers
	JOIN results ON goalscorers.date = results.date
	AND goalscorers.home_team = results.home_team
	AND goalscorers.away_team = results.away_team
	GROUP BY results.tournament
)

SELECT total_goals_per_tournament.tournament As "Tournament", top_scorers.top_scorer AS "Top scorer", top_scorers.goals_scored AS "Goals scored", total_goals_per_tournament.total_goals "Total tournament goals", (top_scorers.goals_scored * 100.0)/total_goals_per_tournament.total_goals AS "Percentage of goals scored by top scorer" FROM total_goals_per_tournament
JOIN top_scorers ON top_scorers.tournament = total_goals_per_tournament.tournament

Question 2:

UPDATE results
SET home_team = "Unknown"
WHERE home_team ISNULL;

UPDATE results
SET away_team = "Unknown"
WHERE away_team ISNULL;

UPDATE results
SET home_score = 0
WHERE home_score < 0;

UPDATE results
SET away_score = "Unknown"
WHERE away_score < 0;

UPDATE shootouts
SET first_shooter = "Unknown"
WHERE first_shooter ISNULL;

UPDATE goalscorers
SET minute = "Unknown"
WHERE minute > 200 OR minute < 0;

UPDATE results
SET country = home_team
WHERE neutral = "FALSE";
